about = """
I'm an expert Software Engineer working professionally since 2010.

I have a deep understanding of fundamental algorithms, data structures, design patterns, principles of OOP and FP.
Additionally, my expertise extends to database internals, query processing, concurrent systems and distributed consensus mechanisms.
I am proficient at writing high-quality, testable code.

I'm a fast learner, I don't fear complex problems, and programming is my true passion.
Leave me with a challenging task and a few people to discuss it with, and I'm a happy guy!
